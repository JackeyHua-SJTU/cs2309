## 2023.10.20 Debugging in VsCode
- Use code runner's shortcut `run code` to compile and run the program
- Configure `tasks.json` to compile the program. Much time-consuming than the first way. Configure `launch.json` to debug the program. Note that, if we need to input while debugging, we can ONLY open a external console and input in that console.
- Quicker way to input and output --- using redirection. `./a.out < input.txt > output.txt`
- Better debugging experience? Turn to Clion for help.
